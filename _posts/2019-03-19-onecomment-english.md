Recently, the police interviewed part of the students supporting Jasic Incident and asked them to watch a video confession. They also “educated” the students in different levels.

>近日，公安局约谈了一部分支持佳士事件的学生，要求观看一部认罪视频，并且对他们进行了不同程度的“教育”。

The contents of the video included the crimes, confessions and complaints of He Pengchao and other 5 arrested workers supporters. They stated the root of their “ultra-left” thoughts that China is not a socialist country anymore because Reform and Open is a capitalist restoration and that only through a violent revolution can the proletarian regime be recaptured. He Pengchao admitted that he plotted Jasic Incident all by himself in order to satisfy his desire for control.

>而认罪视频的内容，是贺鹏超等6位被捕的工人支持者的认罪、忏悔及控诉。他们陈述了自己“极左”思想的来源，说这种极左思想认为现在中国不是社会主义国家，改革开放是资本主义复辟，需要进行暴力革命才能重新夺回无产阶级政权。而贺鹏超承认，为了满足自身的掌控欲，是他一手策划了佳士事件。

The video also declares that all the pioneers who supported Jasic workers were from an illegal organization. Various progressive societies on campus, which functioned as deceiving unsophisticated college students and enticing them into inciting subversion of state power, are "subordinates" of the organization.

>认罪视频里还指认，支持佳士建会工人的正义人士都来自同一个非法组织。各高校进步社团都是这个非法组织的“下级”，用以欺骗单纯的大学生，诱使他们走上煽动颠覆国家政权的道路。

However, is truth like the above? We will make the analysis in the following two aspects.

>那么事情真相果真如此吗？我们且从以下两个方面谈起。

<br />

<h2>First,Is Jasic Incident “self-directed and acted”?</h2>


At first, the reason why the workers decided to form a labor union was exactly to crush Jasic's bans: long-existing harsh management, illegal underpaying system, violation of employee’s privacy, etc. In March 2018 when there is no days off, forcible pedestrianism ignited workers' anger. Progressive workers like Mi Jiuping demanded to form their own labor union and got the permission from the general union of the district. Within a few days, 89 workers had supported them. Apparently, it is their common desire to form a labor union.

>回溯整个佳士事件，工人们决定组建工会的原因就是压榨员工的佳士十八禁令：长期严苛的管理、违规的克扣制度、侵犯员工上厕所的隐私，如此等等。2018年3月份全月无休之后的强制徒步成为了工人维权的导火索。进步工人米久平等人要求组建工人自己的工会，并获得了区总工会的同意，不到几日，便有89位工人支持，可见组建工会是工人们共同的心声！

The desire and the uniting of workers are but an irresistible trend of the long-existing contradiction between labor and capital at Jasic. The video avoided such reality and made a big fuss with words like "organization" and "manipulation" instead. The incident of workers’ maintaining legal rights is garbled into a “workers’ farce", into which “good living conditions of workers” are drummed into. It is easy to know what is covered up when they fabricate a false peace painstakingly.

>佳士工人和厂方之间的矛盾积攒已久，而工人组建工会、走向联合，不过是这一矛盾发展的大势所趋. 视频里避开这一根本的现实矛盾不谈，却拿来什么“组织”、“操纵”等词大做文章，将工人维护自己合法权益的事件丑化成“工闹”反复强调工人的生活其实很好——如此费尽周折地粉饰太平，他们到底想要掩盖什么？答案显而易见。

Since the Reform and Opening Up, the social status of workers suffered a disastrous decline along with the advance of marketization. Old workers of state-owned enterprises, the former national builders, descended to labor force and led a tough life in primary needs like medical treatment and housing. In 2009, tens of thousands of workers from Tonghua Steel, a state-owned enterprise, went on strike in an organized way, strongly protesting the involvement of Jianlong Group, a private capital. The workers rushed into the building angrily towards the initiators. Finally, they won the battle and drove Jianlong out of Tonghua Steel.

>改革开放以来，随着市场化浪潮的推进，工人地位一落千丈，国企老工人从国家的建设者沦为被雇佣的劳动力，连基本的吃饭、看病、住房都成了问题。2009年，近万数通钢国企工人组织起来、罢工游行，强烈抗议建龙集团对原国企通钢的介入。工人们愤怒地冲进大楼，冲向始作俑者。最终他们取得了胜利，把建龙赶出了通钢！

As for the new generation of workers growing up in Reform and Opening up, they have been severely exploited by capital from the beginning, striving to maintain the bottom lifeline. Foxconn’s 13 successive jumps since 2010 revealed the situation of Chinese workers: living without protection and hope. They muttered, “save material, save money, save despair and save sorrow for the future poverty; tomorrow there is nothing except repetition; in the distance there is nothing except poverty, and poverty... (a selection from worker poet Xu Lizhi

>而在改革开放中壮大起来的新一辈工人队伍呢？被资本尽力地压榨，苦苦维持在生活线的最底端。2010年以来富士康的13连跳，揭开了中国工人无法缝合的伤口，昭示了他们没有保障没有希望的人生。他们沉吟着——物质要省下来，金钱要省下/绝望要省下来，悲伤要省下来……用于往后贫穷的生活/明天除了重复什么都没有/远方除了贫穷还是贫穷……（摘自打工诗人许立志《省下来》）

However, there are always new things from contradictions. Workers in the storm has begun to realize that only a unity has the power to improve their tragic lives. Hence, collective rights activism went on stage throughout China one after another. The sparks of fighting will eventually terminate the desperate darkness.

>但是矛盾之中总是孕育着新生。风浪中的新工人开始认识到只有团结才有力量改善他们悲惨的生存环境。于是，一场场工人集体维权行动在广阔的中国大地上接二连三地上演。抗争之举像星星之火终将点燃令人绝望的黑暗——

<br />

In 2010, workers in Honda Automobile Factory successfully won a 33% increase in wage after several months of strike!

>2010年日本本田汽车厂工人经过数月的大罢工，成功争取到调薪33%！

In 2014, workers in Guangzhou University City defended their rights through a 15-day strike and negotiation, reaching an agreement with the employers!

>2014年广州大学城工人维权，经过为期15天的罢工和集体谈判，成功与资方达成了协议！

In 2018, we witnessed strikes involving tower crane operators in various parts of the country, take-away food carriers and sanitation workers in Shanghai and Jasic workers in Shenzhen. Struggle and hope are conceived.

>2018年，全国多个地方的塔吊工人罢工，上海环卫工人罢工、外卖员罢工、佳士工人维权……抗争和希望在不断孕育着。

<br />

During Reform and Opening up, workers suffering from pneumoconiosis are the first batch of victims who descended from masters of China to employed labor force. Currently, there are more than 5 million patients with occupational diseases. They built up prosperity but had themselves lay on sickbeds, with every breath bringing about severe pains. At terminal stages, the patients can but sleep by kneeling and linger out a feeble existence.

>在改革开放的进程中，尘肺病工人是从昔日主人翁沦为雇佣劳动力的第一批牺牲品。当今的中国有500万以上这样的职业病患者，他们建设起了繁荣和腾飞，却让自己倒在了病榻上。得了这种病，病人只能艰难地呼吸，每呼吸一次，都意味着剧烈的痛苦。到了晚期，病人们甚至只能跪着睡觉，他们跪着，苟延残喘地活着。

Desperation propelled them to unite. Now it is the 11th year of the struggle of workers with pneumoconiosis. In the past years, they have gone through perfunctoriness, cheat, suppression， disintegration and multiple repatriation by the authorities. However, they have chosen to stand up before kneeling. Frustration will not foil their will, but stimulate them to grow faster instead!

>绝望让他们走向联合。今年是尘肺病工人维权的第11个年头，十年间，他们经历了政府的敷衍欺骗、暴力镇压、挑拨分化等手段，多次被清场遣返——然而既然已经选择了要站起来，就不可能再跪下去！挫折不能够折损他们的意志，反而让他们更快地成长起来。

As is seen, organizing, uniting and resisting have accorded with the will of the people under ever-violent class oppression. Such historical trend makes it inevitable, and progressive, and typical to stabilize the union of working class, which is exactly the motivation of Jasic workers!

>可以看见，在愈演愈烈的阶级压迫下，组织、联合与抗争，早已成为人心所向的趋势。而佳士工人在历史趋势的推动下，决定通过组建工会的方式稳固这一阶级的联合，这不仅是必然的，更是进步的，堪称为典型了！

Police in Guangdong, regardless of workers’ living conditions, ruthlessly suppressed them and determined the nature of their rights defenses as a farce. Now they are deliberately planning to label them as crimes in order to take the voice of righteous indignation by the throat and ensure that their masters will continue to plug their ears with ease!

>而广东警方不顾工人的生活现状，对他们进行无情的镇压，把工人的维权抗争一股脑地归为阴谋和闹剧，甚至要贴上违法犯罪的标签，好让义愤的声浪被扼住咽喉，大老爷们得以继续掩耳盗铃般高枕无忧！

However, Marxism tells us that social being determines social consciousness. Facing with increasingly fierce class contradictions, no matter how they deceive themselves by fabricating a false peace, the boiling water will never submit to a light pot cover. The rebel class consciousness of workers will inevitably break through all the obstacles!

>但马克思主义告诉我们社会存在决定社会意识，面对愈加激烈的阶级矛盾，再怎样自欺欺人地粉饰太平也终究是在“粉饰”，即将沸腾的水不可能被一个轻飘飘的锅盖压服，觉悟工人反抗压迫的历史潮流必将冲破一切障碍！

<br />

<h2>Second, are left-wing students coerced mindlessly?</h2>

The most classic and ridiculous point of the video is that left-wing societies of college are mispresented as “swindler institutions” which painstakingly coerced the unsophisticated college students to the ultra-left.

>视频里最为经典、令人啼笑皆非的是将高校左翼社团营造成一个“骗子机构”，它费劲心机，将单纯无知的大学生拐到了极左的道路上。

However, what exactly is “ultra-left”?

>然而，到底何为“极左”？

<br />

As the cluster for “New Ant-tribe”, Beisicun accommodates about 6,000 natives and 90,000 nonnatives with more than 90,000 rental houses. The residents are mainly young people working around Zhongguancun and Shangdi. Several mainstream media like CCTV have investigated and reported the phenomenon. Yet in the video confession, it originates from the "black heart" of the "ultra-left society."

>北四村本地人口六千人，外来人口九万人，出租房屋九万余间，居住人口以在中关村、上地附近工作的年轻人为主，是“新蚁族”的聚集地。央视、人民网、澎湃新闻等主流媒体都曾对此做过调查或报道。一到认罪视频之中，却成了“极左社团”的“险恶用心”。

According to China Labor Bulletin, there were more than 1,700 collective worker actions in China in 2018. During a survey from 2015 to 2017, it included 6,694 cases of workers’ collective actions. The control of speech was so strict that even the posts reporting a large-scale strike of OptimumNano in Pingshan was collectively deleted by main media last year. It is conceivable that there are still many worker-rights movements being concealed. A worker who has worked for more than 20 years in about six cities once said, “the factories are all illegal, but seldom investigated". It is the common thinking of thousands of thousands of workers. With universal exploitation in Chinese factories, how can it be that the illegal factories were carefully chosen?

>根据中国劳工通讯的报告，2018年中国发生的工人集体行动就多达1700余起，中国劳工通讯在2015年到2017年的调研期间，收录了6694起工人集体行动个案。言论管控如此严厉的情况下，连去年坪山沃特码的大规模罢工都被各大媒体集体删贴，可想而知，还有多少被掩盖的工人维权事实。一个干了二十多年活、辗转了五六个城市的工人大哥曾经感慨，“厂子都这样，都违法，查都查不过来”——可谓道出了千万工人的心声。中国工厂普遍存在的压迫剥削，哪里是“专挑”小黑厂挑出来的？

In this way, the universality is said to be specific and the reality illusory. Who is "ultra-left" and "coercing" others indeed?

>把普遍的讲成特殊的，把现实的讲成虚假的。到底谁是“极左”，谁在“裹挟”他人呢！

<br />

The video confession also tells us that the reason why left-wing youths put down their studies and devoted themselves to the bottom is that they were “ignorant of world affairs” and “morally hijacked”. Then being “isolated” in the society, they failed to study so that there was no way out but such “crooked ways” after graduation.

>认罪视频还告诉我们，左翼青年们放下学业、献身工农，是因为一开始“不谙世事”，被“道德绑架”无法学习，被“隔离”在社团内，导致毕业时无路可走，只能走上了“歪门邪道”。

It turns out that from their perspective, the most energetic youth are but a group of puppets!

>原来在他们看来，最充满朝气的青年都是一群没有脑子的木偶！

Nevertheless, the fact is that every youth who made progressive choices relating the path of life had experienced harsh ideological struggle. Classrooms are never small, but in order to serve the workers more, they are obliged to make a fresh and overall comprehension of them, and virtually approach them in practice. Therefore, they chose to dedicate their limited time to the bottom as much as possible.

>而事实却是，每一位在人生的道路上做出了进步选择的青年，都曾经历过艰难的思索和权衡。学校的课堂不可谓不大，但是想要为工人们多做一些事情，就需要对工人群体有全面而鲜活的了解，需要真正在实践中走近工人、理解工人。于是，在有限的时间里，他们选择把时间更多地奉献给了工农大众。

Reality is always the best material to educate people. Whenever we think of the suffering of workers: 6 million pneumoconiosis patients or tens of thousands of broken fingers every year at Pearl River Delta, we relieve obsession towards academia. As intellectuals mastering the theoretical weapon: Marxism-Leninism, the left-wing youths has experienced the enslavement of the class society to the vast number of workers, and has appreciated their matchless motivation and spirit to rebel. They resolutely decided to realize the combination between workers and students to propel the struggle of the working class. Should the attitude towards such progressive choices be to defame rather than praise?

>现实总是最能教育人的。无论是600万的尘肺病工人们，还是珠江每年几万根的断指，每当我们念及广大工人们所遭受的苦痛，自己心里对于学术的执念就消解一分。左翼青年作为掌握了马列毛主义这一理论武器的知识分子，在现实的教育下，领略了阶级社会对广大劳动者的奴役，领略了数量最为庞大的工人阶级最具有反抗的动力、精神和必要性，毅然决定要实现工学的结合，将自己的青春奉献于为工人阶级奋斗的事业当中。对待这样的进步选择，难道不是值得歌颂，反而是应该出言诋毁的吗？

The Marxist-Leninists are by no means without feelings. Their feelings are merely about the common causes for laborers of the world instead of themselves. With time going by, they became nonchalant to selfish interests. Only common beliefs will hold together kinship, friendship and love.

>马列毛主义者也决非没有感情。只不过他们的感情不为己不为私，而是为着天下劳动者站起来的共同理想。一己私情因为时间的冲洗而变得淡漠乏味，而最能够维系亲情、友情和爱情的，只有共同的理想和信念。


Facing such an awe-inspiring road, the evil forces in the public securities became feeble. They had no choice but to blindly copy the accusation like "ultra-left" and "illegality" for the society. The following three purposes are plotted simultaneously: to confuse the thoughts of college students, to arouse the resentment of parents and the masses not knowing the situation, to sensitize the concept "combination of workers and students".

>在这样可谓无畏又凛然的左翼道路面前，公检法中的黑恶势力也显得虚弱了。他们只好生搬硬套、故技重施，给社团扣上又是什么“极左”，又是什么“非法”的帽子，企图以此混乱大学生的思想，激起不明就里的家长和群众的愤恨，让“工学结合”成为敏感又危险的词语，可谓一箭三雕啊。

However, the conspiracy is destined not to become bright. In the class society, the contradictions will only intensify. An increasing number of youths will wake up with a bounce when touching the reality. The road of combining workers and students will surely become their life choice and develop wider all the more!

>然而，阴谋注定只是阴谋，永远不会成为什么光明的东西。在阶级社会里，矛盾只会愈演愈烈，越来越多的青年将会在触碰现实之时猛地惊醒，工学结合的道路也必将成为青年们不二的人生选择，左翼青年们的道路总是要越走越宽的！

<br />
　　
<h2>What is the significance of this video confession?</h2>


They cunningly intend to use this confession video to completely undermine the significance of Jasic Movement and the legitimacy of the combination between students and workers.

>他们狡黠地，想要用这份认罪视频釜底抽薪，彻底否定掉佳士运动的意义，否定掉工学结合这一道路的合法性。

In order to nip the resistance in the bud and keep themselves safe, the evil forces in politics-and-law systems continued to exert press on all the righteous who support Jasic Movement with the concocted video confession.

>为了将反抗的力量扼杀在摇篮里，为了黑恶力量能继续安然苟活，配合着这份炮制出来的认罪视频，来自公检法中黑恶势力持续的压力也不断施加到所有支持佳士运动的正义人士身上。

They have tried their best: for students on campus, they tried the carrot and stick approach to indoctrinate them with the argument of "illegal organization" and threat them with their studies, families and even arrests to force them to "confess". For other comrades in prison, they must have extorted confessions by torture in order to get that they want. Meanwhile, they described the progressive societies on campus as illegal organizations which deluded students.

>他们想尽了办法。对在校学生，软硬兼施，不停地灌输那套“非法组织”的论调，又以学业、家庭、抓捕的手段赤裸裸地威胁，想要逼迫他们“悔过认罪”。对其他在狱中坚守的同志，为了得到想要的口供，他们必定也要严刑逼供，强迫认罪。与此同时，他们把高校进步社团描摹成这一组织迷惑学生的非法团体。

In this way, they can say, "You see, that's the truth! Participating Jasic Incident is participating illegal organizations. Jasic incident is but a self-directed farce!" If there are ever such protests in the future, the progressive youths will become accomplices to incite overthrow of the regime.

>这样一来，他们便说，“看哪，事实就是如此！参与佳士事件就是参与非法组织，佳士事件不过是一场自导自演的闹剧！”倘若之后还有此类抗争运动，还有此类进步青年，便都成了煽动颠覆国家政权的帮凶！

Video confessions will definitely cause ideological confusion among the masses. Unknowing masses may be blindfolded by the lies into believing that there is a conspiracy behind it whenever they inadvertently see the video with reactionaries' incitement. The spread of the confession also brought about negative moods among some left-wing comrades. They believe that the movement has caused so many sacrifices and the situation is not promising. They even doubt the significance of previous struggles.

>认罪视频也必定在群众中引起思想混乱。不明就里的群众，无意间看见了这一定性视频，再辅之以反动派的煽风点火，一时可能会被这些谎言遮住双眼，认为佳士运动背后确有阴谋。而随着定性之风的盛传，左翼群众中也有部分同志产生了悲观消极的情绪，认为运动已经导致了太多的牺牲，形势不容乐观，甚至因此对之前的斗争也产生怀疑。

<br />

So to speak, the video confession is deliberately aimed at thoroughly cracking down the strongest forces of the left wing with the charges. It is undoubtedly a huge challenge to the left-wing groups!

>可以说，公检法中黑恶势力的这次定罪视频是用心险恶，他们想要用“非法”的罪名彻底打击掉左翼中的坚挺力量，这对左翼道路来说无疑是一次巨大的挑战！

Nevertheless, the history is moving forward regardless of being covered up with empty lies. The boiling water has shouldered a crack on the pot lid and the masses will sharpen their eyes with the education of realistic contradictions just like the inspired masses during Jasic Movement. Those not affected by lies will look through the dark essence of the reactionists’ plot and thus strengthen their beliefs in struggling.

>然而历史的车轮滚滚向前，这从来不是用虚无的谎言能够遮盖得了的。沸腾的水已经把锅盖顶开了一道口子，群众在一次次现实矛盾的教育中必将睁开双眼——就像在佳士运动中许许多多被启发的群众那样。而那些不会被谎言影响了判断力的群众，将从这次定性及反动派的阴谋中看破他们的丑陋嘴脸，从而更加坚定斗争的信念。

It is true that Jasic Movement has suffered heavy loss by now. However, on the road of resisting oppression on workers, sacrifice is inevitable and will not undermine the significance of the movement. It is a new chapter in the history of the combination between workers and students, having led all the left-wing groups bold enough in resisting oppression in front of people from all over China, even the world. It enabled the qualified left-wings to unite and forge a group of young pioneers. The movement also united groups of people around the left wing and effectively cracked the arrogance of the reactionaries.

>佳士运动发展至今，固然是有了比较大的牺牲。但是在工人反抗压迫的道路上，牺牲在所难免，佳士运动的意义无法磨灭。这次运动是工学结合的历史新篇章，它带领着一切敢于反抗压迫的左翼群体走到了全国甚至世界人民的视野，使真正的左翼拧成了一股绳，锻造出了一批青年先锋。运动还在左翼周围影响、团结了一批群众，有力打击了反动派的气焰。

Facing with the sacrifices, we should not be frightened into submission by the superficial power of the reactionaries because they are losing people's support behind their crazy counter-attack. Instead, we should get reorganized, summarize the experience and lessons of Jasic Movement, remember its great significance, take over the great flag and keep going with more firmness as soon as possible.

>面对已有的牺牲，我们不应该被反动派强大的表面所吓倒，看不到它在疯狂反扑的背后人心的丢失，而应该尽快重振旗鼓，总结运动中出现的经验和教训，牢记佳士运动的伟大意义，接过这一伟大旗帜，去更加坚定地行动下去。

<br />

**The future road is a bright one waiting for us to go on exploring.**

>未来的路，应该是由我们继续去探索的光明大道。
