Recently, some members of the progressive associations of various universities were interviewed by the Beijing police, requesting to watch a video of thoughts involving the Jasic supporters. The contents are regret of people who has missed for several months. They are He Pengchao and Wang Xiangyi, founders of Shenzhen Qingying Social Work Center, Hou Changshan, Qingying community staff, Zheng Shiyou, worker supporter, Zong Yang, graduate of Peking University, and Zheng Yiran, graduate of Beijing Language and Culture University.

>日前，各高校进步社团的部分社员受到北京市公安局的约谈，要求观看一部涉及佳士声援人员的所思所想的视频。其内容是失踪长达数月的深圳青鹰社工中心创始人贺鹏超及王相宜、青鹰社区工作人员侯长珊、工人支持者郑时友、北京大学毕业生宗扬、北京语言大学毕业生郑依然6人的“悔过”。

In order to clarify the facts, the details of the Regret Video are now issued according to the students' memories. Please understand if there are any gaps.

>为澄清事实，现将这份“悔过视频”细节根据同学回忆整理发出。根据回忆整理，如有缺漏，敬请谅解

<h2>Part one: How did their ultra-leftist thought come from?</h2>

Scene: indoor

<br/>

He Pengchao (wearing a black shirt):

>贺鹏超（身穿黑色衬衫）：

In 2007, I listened to the lecture held by Utopia. It was my first contact with the left wing. The speaker was Qiu Shike, and the content was about the Cultural Revolution. At that time, I just had a fuzzy understanding of the Cultural Revolution and I have not begun to deny the Reform and Opening up. By the time of 2011, I joined the Peking University Marxism Society. The learning of the society is all about the logic of the Cultural Revolution. They made us think that the first 30 years of People's Republic of China were the period of socialist countries. But the Reform and Opening up is the restoration of capitalism and the process of taking power from the capitalists. Only through violent revolution can socialism be re-established. Later, I went to work in the factory twice with the people belong to Qiushi Society, and I met Zheng Hao (Zheng Shiyou), when they made worker movement in the South. Later, I established Fenghua Company, whose was positioned as a semi-professional revolutionary organization. At that time I had doubts about the violent revolution, but the organization said that I was not determined. Later, I started to be a professional revolutionary.

>我最开始是2007年的时候听了乌有之乡举办的讲座，主讲人是秋石客，内容是关于文革。那时候只是对于文革有个认识，还没有开始否定改革开放。但是到2011年的时候加入了北大马会。学会的学习都是围绕文革逻辑展开的，让我们觉得前三十年才是社会主义国家，改革开放是资本主义复辟，是走资派掌权的过程。只有通过暴力革命才能重新建立社会主义。后来跟求是学会的人一起去打了两次工，认识了郑昊（郑时有），那时候他们在南方搞工运。后来成立了风华公司，定位是半职业革命者组织，边做科研边干革命。我本来当时对暴力革命有过疑问，组织就说我这是不坚定。后来，开始做职业革命者。

This organization ethically abducts you with the slogan of serving the proletariat. In fact, we use the red flag to against the red flag. We have not seen the efforts made by the party and the government and the actual work we have done harms workers and the country. Last year, Zhang Yunfan’ s affairs were actually plotting and inciting subversion of state power. However, we promoted it as a study of Marxism in a socialist country but was suppressed. By propagating the Chinese Communist Party to suppress Marxism, we want the Chinese Communist Party to lose face. In particular, it may be exploited by some foreign media outside the hostile forces, which was very harmful. We were all under the banner of serving the proletariat, but after this period of reflection, I realized that I also mixed my own selfishness.

>这个组织喊着为无产阶级服务，给你进行道德绑架，实际上打着红旗反红旗。没有看到党和国家做出的努力，而我们做的实际危害工人和国家利益。去年张云帆这些人的事，实际上是密谋策划煽动颠覆国家政权，却把它宣传成是在社会主义国家学马克思主义却被打压，利用这个宣传中国共产党打压马克思主义，让中国共产党下不来台。尤其是可能被境外敌对势力一些境外媒体所利用，这是危害很大的。我们一切都打着为无产阶级服务的旗号，但是通过这段时间反思之后我认识到也掺杂了自己的私心。

<br/>

Zheng Shiyou (in a black jacket):

>郑时友（身穿黑色外套）：

……

I joined the Chinese Maoist Communist Party.

>我加入了中国毛泽东主义共产党。

<br/>

Zong Yang (wearing a black jacket):

>宗扬（身穿黑色外套）：

When I was a freshman in the college, I joined the Peking University Marxism Society, because I had some radical ideas. After I entered the society, I became more sympathetic to the ultra-leftist thinking. I felt that I could only rebuild the socialism by relying on a violent revolution.

>我是大一的时候加入了北大马会，因为自己本来有些激进思想，进去马会后就更加认同极左思想，觉得只有依靠暴力革命才能回到社会主义。

<br/>

<h2>Part two: the "inside stories" of the Jasic incident.</h2>
　
(The scene was turned to outside)

<br/>

Zheng Shiyou:

>郑时友:

The organization planned to organize a worker movement in the south. We ususally followed a protocol of 3 months, first filtering out some "proper" factories, then insert our men in to "incite" the workers when the odds are in our favour. In 2016, we designated two companies for the "incitation" - one was Jasic Technology, and another was xxx. But we didn't make it; on the contrary we first enlarged our ranks, and make them staying in a factory.
　　
>组织计划在南方搞工人运动。我们一般是以三个月为周期，先调研筛选一些合适的厂，然后安插人员进厂，伺机挑动工人，搞“工闹”。这次佳士事件也是我们一手策划的。16年，我们先选定了两个公司进行工闹：佳士和xxx，但后来没有这样做，先做工作发展人，在一个厂能够长时间待着。

<br/>

He Pingchao:

>贺鹏超:

To provide rear support I created Qingying NGO.The Jasic incident was planned in August 2016. After the filtering I chose the Jasic Technology and made Zou Liping to work in the Communittee Labor Union, and some others into the Jasic Tech. Our objective of struggle was to organize the labor union. Soon after, Liu Penghua and Mi Jiuping we send in were compromised prematurely, and I thought that the odds were then with us, so we use the public opinion of labor union as a cover. Therefore, the labor union was not the opinion of workers, but all plotted. On July 20th, Mi Jiupeng and others asked to return to their post, who were in fact about to spread propaganda in the factory, and was blocked by the security guards. The police then came, they bluffed that the police officers abused them, in order to buy some time for the propaganda. Then we organized them to "siege" the police station and forced them to release the imprisoned. On July 21st, I asked them to press on at the police station to ask for apology and reparation. And asked Li Zhan and Lan Zhiwei to the police station to ask for the release of the others. Then I arranged "Shidaixianfeng" to spread propaganda on the Interet, because all our "first-lines" in Pingshan were detained. Then we arranged Shen Mengyu, a "first-line" in Guangzhou to call for the Left-Wings all over the country for support, and arranged Yue Xin and Zheng Yongming for foreign media, to enlarge the public opinions and put pressure on interior authorities.

>为提供后方支援，我成立了青鹰。佳士事件是从2016年8月开始策划的。经过筛选，我选定了佳士厂，安排了邹丽萍进去社区工联工作，又安插了人进入佳士厂，确立了以组建工会的斗争为导向。没多久派进去的刘鹏华和米久平就提前被发现了，我觉得建会斗争的时机也合适了，就用组建工会的舆论等掩盖，让厂里聚焦于这件事上来。所以建会根本不是工人主动要建的，是已经策划好的。7月20日，米久平等要求复工，实际是去厂内进行宣传，但却被保安提前阻拦，派出所来了，就捏造警察打人，为在厂内宣传赢得了时间。随后我安排了他们去冲击派出所，派出所把抓的人放，7月21日再次安排他们去给派出所施压，想乘胜冲击派出所，争取到道歉和赔偿。之后又安排蹲守在周边的李展和兰志伟去要求派出所放人。期间安排“时代先锋”等进行线上舆论造势，因为坪山“一线”的都进去了，后来又安排广州“一线”的沈梦雨呼吁全国左翼去坪山声援，安排岳欣、郑永明等联系外媒采访，增加舆论影响，给国内施压。

<br/>

Zong Yang (Wearing a black sweater) :

>宗扬（身穿黑色卫衣）：

I led the others (students) to work in the south during the summer vacation. After that I took part in the online propaganda campaign of the Jasic Incident. We had the facts black and white reversed to bluff the mass. After the crackdown on August 24th we were not reconciled about the consequences, so we plotted three other struggles: first is the strugglement for resuming classes. Because when the students were sent back, they were asked to take a leave of absence by their universities. So I arranged that struggle to put pressure on schools. The second was "Finding Yues" campaign. We were about to copy the pattern of November 15th Incident (Reading club incident in Guangzhou), using public opinions to put pressure on. The third was the society defend campaign, student societies being controlled by the organization was rectificated by the universities, so I launched the campaign to protect these societies.

>我暑假带了大家（指学生们）去南方打工。后来参与了安排佳士事件的网上宣传，我们截取一些黑白颠倒的东西发到网上进行误导。后来8.24清场之后我们觉得这个结果不甘心，就又组织了三次斗争。一个是复课斗争，这是因为部分学生被遣返以后受到了学校的休学要求，所以我就趁势安排了返校斗争，给学校施压；第二个是寻月行动，试图复制11.15（指广州读书会事件）的斗争模式，进行舆论施压，以达到放回岳欣和顾佳悦的目的；第三个是社团保卫战，组织控制的这些社团因为从事非法活动被学校整改，我于是发起了社团保卫战，目的是给学校施压，保护这些社团。

<br/>

Wang Xiangyi (indoor, wearing light-red coat):

>王相宜（室内，穿着淡红色外套）：

I didn't directly take part in the Jasic Incident, but I took part in the negotiation between them and the authority, to prove that we (Qingying) were not related to the case. We provide students to the frontlines of Jasic Incident, record the contacts and maintain contacts with them to ensure the unity of minds. We provided them fake ID cards and SIM cards.

>我虽然没有直接参与佳士事件，但是我主要负责了和政府交涉，证明我们（指青鹰）和这件事没有关系。并且向佳士战场输送实习生，记录各地的联系地址，经常和他们保持联系，保证我们思想上的统一。为他们提供假身份证和电话卡等。
 

<br/>

<h2>Part three: Many of the participants are college graduates. Why are so many college students involved?</h2>

(Scene Change: Inside a room)

<br/>

He Pengchao:

>贺鹏超:

We controlled the far-left community by means of the Students' Association Union. We targeted at freshmen, because they're new in college, and they don't know anything. Their minds are easily changed by us.In this time we took advantage of some of the current imbalances in order to turn their perceptions upside down. Then we took them into the factory as social practice activities, let them experience the life of workers. To what a factory? We specialize in the darkest little factories. After a while, the students would find the factory too dark. They found that even they themselves could not bear such a life, and the workers also could not bear it any more. So the students got the impression that the life of underclass were miserable. Therefore, they mistakenly believed that there is a capitalist society now, and they have come up with the idea of a return to Mao and the Socialism in the time of the Cultural Revolution.

>我们通过“社联”控制的极左社团，专挑大一新生入手，因为他们刚来大学，什么都不知道，思想更容易改变，这时候我们就利用现在一些发展不平衡的问题来颠覆他们以前的认知。然后带他们实践进厂打工，体验工人的生活。去的什么厂呢？我们专门选一些最黑的小厂，干了一段时间，学生们发现这厂太黑了，一想自己都受不了，那工人更受不了了，所以产生了底层工人很惨的印象，让他们认同现在是资本主义社会的假象，要回到毛时代文革时期的社会主义。

Our organization also believes that learning is bourgeois scholarship. Capitalist scholarship is about self-interest (sarcastic dismissive tone) and a reluctance to give. We use this kind of moral kidnapping to make students give up their own personal future, their own personal interests, and even their family, their love.

>我们这个组织也认为，学习是搞资产阶级学术，学了就是注重自己的私利，（讽刺不屑的语气）不愿意奉献，用这样的道德绑架让学生们放弃自己的个人前途呀，自己的个人私利，甚至家庭，爱情。

And there's one more thing in this group that you must report your personal relationships to the organisation. You're not allowed to be in love with one who is outside of the group. When already so, you have to break up. Even if you are in love with somebody within the group, your relationship must also be checked by the group and report consistently to it. You should not chat with him/her avoiding the group. People have no privacy of their own.

>而且这个组织还有一点，个人的恋爱情况也要汇报，不允许和组织外的人谈恋爱，谈了也要分手，即使是组织内的人，也要经过组织审查，向组织汇报，聊天内容不能避开组织，没有一点自己个人的隐私。

<br/>

Zong Yang:

>宗扬:

We used some leftist articles and some one-sided material to give the students an impression that the workers were miserable.

>我们利用一些左派的文章，和一些片面的材料，给学生们造成工人很惨的假象。

<br/>

Zheng Yiran: (in a room, Zheng sits on a chair next to a table. Zheng is angry.)

>郑依然 （在一个客厅里，郑坐在椅子上，旁边有一张桌子，郑的表情义愤填膺）:

We just take advantage of the fact that freshmen are very simple as they are new in the university. At this time, a senior who specifically cares you and says to you, "Have you got used to the campus? Have you met any difficulties in your study and your life? " (she says, knocking the table with her hand.) So they think the seniors are too nice. Then we cut them off as much as possible, from their roommates and boyfriends to get rid of their influence. By going for a run, eating, studying and talking together, we were going to occupy their time and avoid them from contacting with their classmates. So they were enclosed in a circle and accepted our ideas.

>我们就是利用大一新生，一进校都特别单纯，这时候有特别关心你的学长学姐对你说：进来学校有没有适应啊，学习生活有没有困难呀，（边说，边用手拍着桌子）他们就觉得这些学长学姐太好了。然后尽量切断他们原来的关系，不让和室友啊男朋友啊接触，因为会受他们的影响。通过约跑约饭约自习，谈心，挤占时间，不让她和其他同学接触，封闭在一个圈子里，接受我们的思想。

We'll take them to the North Four village (Běisìcūn) and tell them, "here is where you're going to live". Let them feel that now the life of college graduates is really miserable, graduates cannot find a job, even the best people can only live here, their own future is in the dark. And we said, the learning is useless. Let them do their homework by plagiarizing and fail the exams. They shouldn't go to classes or they're not advanced and not willing to give up their own personal interests. The idea that good study is so-called "sophisticated egoism" makes you shy away from it. By senior year, the longer they were in the organization, the more they didn't know anything. Therefore they do know nothing when they graduate from the college. If one can't do anything, (pats the table with his hand) there is no job for him. Then this way become their only way.

>实践带他们去北四村，跟他们说这就是你未来住的地方，让他们觉得现在大学毕业生真惨，出来找不到工作，就连最优秀的人都只能住在这里，自己的前途一片黑暗。于是就说现在上学没用。写作业靠抄，考试不及格。不翘课就不先进，是不愿意放弃自己个人的私利，好好学习就是精致利己主义，让人也就不好意思去学习了。所以这样，被裹挟深一点的，到了大四，真的是什么都不会，你说什么都不会，（用手拍着桌子）找工作谁要他呀，那肯定就只能走这条路了。

<br/>

Hou Changshan: (the light in the room is dark. Hou is wearing a aquamarine coat, and she looks angry and remorseful.)

>侯长珊:（房间光线比较暗，侯身穿水红色外套，表情很气愤悔恨）

My family and I have always been very close, but the organization said that the family is feudal bondage, family feeling is a mask, and the family relationship is actually based on a consideration of interests. I was the biggest victim in the aspect of love (crying) , I broke up with my boyfriend because of them, when He Pengchao forced me to send Li Rendi (ex-boyfriend) text messages as he dictated, "Never get back together, never meet again." He Pengchao said that Li is an opportunist and he must be knocked down. In fact I was the biggest victim.

>我从小和我的家人感情特别好，但是组织说，家庭是什么封建束缚，亲情是面具，实际上有利益的考量。感情上我才是一个最大的受害者（哭了），我和我的男朋友就是因为他们才分手的，当时贺鹏超逼着我给李仁钬（前男友）发短信，在旁边一个字一个字地念给我输，“永无复合可能，再不见面”，说要彻底批倒批臭他这个投机分子。我才是最大的受害者。


<h2>Part four: what do they want to say about what they have done?</h2>

<br/>

He Pengchao (in a black sweater):

>贺鹏超（身穿黑色毛衣）：

I am a Ph.D. in physics at Peking University (wry smile). I can do such a thing, which means that it is not far for you. I want to say that the Jasic incident is a farce that I personally compile and direct. Although it is for the rights of workers, it also mixed with my personal desires. I want to fulfill my desire to control and fulfill my political goals by defending the rights of workers. I am really sorry (low bow expressed regret).

>我是一个北大的物理学博士(苦笑)，我能做出这样的事情，那说明离你们也不远了，我想说，佳士事件是我一个人自编自导自演的一场闹剧，虽然是为工人维权，但也掺杂了我个人的私欲，满足自己的控制欲，实现我的政治目的，我真的对不起(低头表示十分后悔)。

<br/>

Zong Yang:

>宗扬：

It is fourth or fifth years from the freshman to graduation. I have to apologize to my parents and many people who care about me. I want to apologize to those who have been deceived.

>从大一到毕业四五年了，我要向父母还有很多关心自己的人道歉。向那些被裹挟的同学们道歉。

<br/>

Wang Xiangyi:

>王相宜:

The Christie's case was exploited by a small group of people with ulterior motives. I really wasted my precious youth in this matter (Worry), and I didn't learn anything in university. I did a lot of harm to others, which not only did not help the workers, but also hurt a lot of students. I regret it now.

>佳士事件是被一小部分别有用心的人的利益所利用的。我真的在这个事上浪费了自己宝贵的青春，（苦笑）大学什么都没学到，还没有帮到工人，害了很多学生，做的真是损人不利己，我现在非常后悔。
　　

　
Zheng Yiran:

>郑依然：

The four years in college are the best days of our life, but I have not done anything in school for four years. I regret ruining my precious time very much. I want to say to the students still at school： please wake up, don't be addicted to it, and cherish your time.

>大学四年是人生最美好的日子，在学校里这四年我却什么都没有干，让宝贵的时间就这样荒废了，我非常后悔。我想对还在校的同学们说，醒醒吧，不要再沉迷于这些了，珍惜自己的时间。
